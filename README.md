> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

This repository contains configuration and tools around [git][]. It aims to be
used with [vcsh-home][] and [sh-config][] at least.

This repository currently contains :

* A lot of alias for [git][] and [git-annex][] as a few "new" commands (from
  me or from others like @aspiers, etc…).
* A modular configuration, generating the final ``.gitconfig``.
* Some shell stuff (completion, prompt modification, etc…)
